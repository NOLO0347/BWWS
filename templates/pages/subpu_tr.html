        <h1>Submersible Pump Troubleshooting</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        Submersible pumps, built to last in tight, corrosive water well
        environments, can prove nearly inaccessible when suspended 10 feet from
        the bottom of such a well â€” often over 300 feet deep. This can make
        maintenance issues hard to diagnose, as well as leave the equipment
        susceptible to ambient temperatures, rainfall and drought. A rise in
        residential housing construction coupled with increasing water scarcity
        have caused a boom in the submersible well pump market, making the
        ability to quickly troubleshoot existing pump issues critical in aiding
        pump longevity.

                <td>
                  If the fuses blow while the pump is operating, sand or grit
                  may have become wedged in the impeller, causing the rotor to
                  lock. To check this, pull the pump - disassemble and clean.
                  Before replacing, make sure that sand has settled in the well.
                  If well is chronically sandy, a submersible pump should not be
                  used.

                  Well production may be too low for pump capacity. Restrict
                  flow of pump output, wait for well to recover,and start pump.
                  If partial restriction corrects trouble, leave valve or cock
                  at restricted setting. Otherwise, lower pump in well if depth
                  is sufficient. Do not lower if sand clogging might occur.

                  The presence of abrasive in the water may result in wear on
                  the impeller, casing, and other close-clearance parts. Before
                  pulling pump, reduce setting on pressure switch to see if
                  pumps shuts off. If it does, worn parts are probably at fault.
